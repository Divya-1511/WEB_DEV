            <p>Mechanical keyboards have high-quality switches beneath the keys, making them extremely robust and enjoyable to type on. Since mechanical keyboards use a key switch with a spring inside, you can feel (and sometimes hear) a distinctive click.
                These keyboards can last for years without giving up on you. A typical mechanical keyboard’s keys can withstand up to 70 million keystrokes, which means they can last up to 10 years on average.
                <br> In contrast, most keyboards that come bundled with branded PCs or laptops are membrane keyboards. Membrane-based keyboards often feel mushy and they can wear down very easily. Moreover, they don’t offer a satisfying feel while you
                type. If you have a laptop or a branded PC, or if you purchased an affordable keyboard at a nearby store, you most probably have a membrane keyboard.
